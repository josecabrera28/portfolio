            Welcome to my software developer portfolio! I'm Jose Cabrera, a dedicated and driven
             Java developer with a passion for web application development. Currently pursuing a 
             Software Engineering Technician diploma at Centennial College, I possess a strong
              foundation in Java, Python, C#, and web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
               My expertise extends to database management with MySQL and MongoDB. With experience in 
               full-stack development, I have successfully contributed to projects utilizing the 
               Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern and collaborated effectively within teams 
               using GitHub. With excellent problem-solving skills and a strong analytical mindset,
                I strive to deliver high-quality solutions. Let's build something amazing together!
